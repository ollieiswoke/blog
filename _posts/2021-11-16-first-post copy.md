# AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC AND SECURITY
## Summary of a journal:
The paper "How do people judge risks: Availability heuristic, affect heuristic, or both?" explored how 2 cognitive biases (availability heuristic and affect heuristic) affect students ability to perceive risk. They found that the availability heuristic described their responses best.
## What is the Availability heuristic?
* Guessing the probability or frequency of an event based on how easily it is to recall instances like that. For example, middle aged people might guess the risk of heart attacks by remembering times where friends experienced heart attacks.
* Some scholars (Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs) are known for exploring how availability heuristic relates to risk judgements
* What causes an event to be "easy to recall"?
    * Direct suffering (close friend or relative experienced it)
    * Indirect suffering (seen in the media)

## How can the availability heuristic be exploited? + Sec implications
Skewed reporting of events in the media make people think they are more likely. Similarly, maybe security defenders have a skewed idea of what attacks will happen, based on the attacks they've seen happen in real life or in the media.  
As an attacker, you can exploit the availability bias by making attacks that are hard to recall. This is why security through obscurity is actually good when you're an attacker. Here is the flow chart type explanation.
1. A type of attack is obscure
2. So it's hard for defenders to recall it.
3. So defenders don't think it'll happen. 
4. So they won't defend against it  


Some more thoughts:
* Maybe obscure boring attacks are better than obscure dramatic attacks. Dramatic things are easier to recall (also see - the affect bias)
* In the media (indirect suffering) we see hackers are super technical, therefore anticipate and defend against technical attacks (secure aeroplane doors, encryption etc). This perhaps overlooks all the social engineering that could take place. The availability bias makes social engineering even stronger.
